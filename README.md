# 🧑‍💼 Job Portal - MERN Stack Application

The **Job Portal** is a full-stack web app built using the **MERN stack** —  
**MongoDB**, **Express.js**, **React**, and **Node.js**.  

It allows  
**Employers** to post job openings, and  
**Job Seekers** to explore and apply for jobs based on their skills.  

Currently, the **Employer Module** is fully completed, featuring  
secure authentication and complete job CRUD management.  
Next, we’ll move on to the **Job Seeker Module** (profile, apply jobs, resume upload).
