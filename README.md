# 🧑‍💼 Job Portal - MERN Stack Application

The **Job Portal** is a full-stack web app built using the **MERN stack** —  
**MongoDB**, **Express.js**, **React**, and **Node.js**.  

It provides a platform where  
**employers can post job openings** and  
**job seekers can create profiles, search, and apply** for jobs matching their skills.  

Currently, the project focuses on building a  
**secure authentication system** using **JWT** and **bcrypt** —  
laying the base for future features like  
**job management**, **profile dashboards**, and **application tracking**.  

This project demonstrates my skills in  
**backend API design**, **RESTful architecture**,  
and **scalable MERN development**.
